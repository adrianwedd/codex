title: Clarify sandbox documentation
category: Governance
priority: P1
effort: 2
rationale: |
  Referencing the Opportunity Scan in SELF_AUDIT, clearer documentation of environment constraints helps users avoid surprises and reduces support friction.
description: |
  - Add a dedicated section in project docs outlining sandbox limitations
  - Provide examples of commands that may fail and suggested workarounds
  - Mention version and network constraints explicitly
acceptance_criteria:
  - New documentation page exists and is referenced from README
  - CI passes after documentation update
dependencies: []

title: Automate recurring self-audits
category: Enhancement
priority: P2
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Regular audits encourage continuous improvement as noted in SELF_AUDIT section 5. Automating them ensures issues surface promptly.
description: |
  - Create a scheduled workflow that generates an updated SELF_AUDIT.md
  - Store the audit history for comparison across releases
  - Notify maintainers when new audits are available
acceptance_criteria:
  - Workflow runs at defined intervals
  - Generated audits are committed or archived
  - Maintainers receive notification
dependencies: [1]

title: Adjust tests for sandbox compatibility
category: Remediation
priority: P0
effort: 5
rationale: |
  Current test failures stem from restricted process management. Aligning tests with sandbox behavior (SELF_AUDIT section 6) will restore confidence in automated checks.
description: |
  - Identify tests that assume unrestricted process control
  - Introduce mocks or skips when necessary
  - Document how to run full tests outside the sandbox
acceptance_criteria:
  - Test suite passes in the sandboxed environment
  - Documentation explains remaining exclusions
dependencies: []

title: Establish output quality metrics
category: Research
priority: P1
effort: 3
rationale: |
  SELF_AUDIT highlights the need for metric-driven evaluation. Defining measurable quality indicators supports objective improvement efforts.
description: |
  - Research existing metrics for code-generation agents
  - Select a small set of meaningful indicators (e.g., lint errors, test coverage)
  - Prototype a reporting mechanism
acceptance_criteria:
  - Metrics are defined and documented
  - Initial reports available for at least one release
dependencies: []

id: 5
title: Encourage community feedback
category: Enhancement
priority: P2
effort: 2
rationale: |
  Direct input from users, as mentioned in the Opportunity Scan, reveals pain points that may not appear in automated tests.
description: |
  - Provide a template for issue submissions related to agent behavior
  - Promote discussion channels for suggestions
  - Review feedback regularly during retrospectives
acceptance_criteria:
  - Issue template merged
  - Documented process for triaging feedback
  - Evidence of periodic reviews
dependencies: []

title: Review runtime version support
category: Governance
priority: P1
effort: 2
rationale: |
  SELF_AUDIT notes a risk stemming from dependency on specific versions. A review ensures broader compatibility and smoother upgrades.
description: |
  - Inventory current runtime versions in use
  - Define minimum and recommended versions
  - Outline upgrade procedures
acceptance_criteria:
  - Version matrix documented in repository
  - Upgrade guidelines available for maintainers
dependencies: []

id: 7
title: Explore ethical implications of agent decisions
category: Research
priority: P2
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Addressing ethical considerations (SELF_AUDIT section 6) mitigates potential harm and fosters trust.
description: |
  - Investigate ethical guidelines relevant to autonomous agents
  - Summarize key concerns and mitigation strategies
  - Present findings to maintainers for discussion
acceptance_criteria:
  - Ethics summary document created
  - Action items proposed based on research
dependencies: []

title: Implement dependency update monitoring
category: Enhancement
priority: P2
effort: 3
rationale: |
  Staying informed about upstream changes reduces unexpected breakage and aligns with best practices highlighted under External Inspiration.
description: |
  - Configure automated checks for new package releases
  - Notify maintainers when critical updates are available
  - Integrate update status into self-audit workflow
acceptance_criteria:
  - Monitoring tool active and producing logs
  - Update notifications verified
  - Audit references dependency status
dependencies: []

title: Create fallback plan for platform-specific tests
category: Remediation
priority: P1
effort: 2
rationale: |
  Some tests may only run on certain platforms. Providing a fallback or skip strategy keeps pipelines green while signaling coverage gaps.
description: |
  - Tag platform-specific tests with clear metadata
  - Provide instructions for running them in full-feature environments
  - Ensure CI marks them as skipped rather than failed when unsupported
acceptance_criteria:
  - CI output shows skipped tests with rationale
  - Documentation describes how to run them manually
dependencies: [3]

id: 10
title: Track audit-driven improvements over time
category: Research
priority: P2
effort: 2
rationale: |
  Capturing the effect of completed tasks links back to the Reflection Summary, showing tangible progress.
description: |
  - Maintain a changelog of implemented audit recommendations
  - Periodically evaluate whether metrics improve
  - Share trends with the community
acceptance_criteria:
  - Changelog of improvement tasks exists
  - Metrics demonstrate at least one measurable gain after implementation
dependencies: [2,4]
